# DIY Servo

Implementation of the Servo class API from the official Arduino libraries.
Provides the same methods and public members that the official Servo class does.

Unlike the official library, this one only works on the board I have (ATMEGA328P) and has support for only 2 motors on pins 9 & 10.

## Why?

Just a learning exercise for me.
 Also, the included test program is 2496 bytes (7%) with my library and 3570 bytes (11%) with the official one.

##### This will probably work on your Arduino UNO, but I can't guarantee a bug free experience :|
